`maketex`
=========

> World's Best(TM) LaTeX Makefile solution

Synopsis
--------

Shove it into your _LaTeX_ project and call GNU `make`.
`make` can be obtained from your package manager, or grab a prebuilt binary for Windows.

Details
-------
It does not aim for being the most extensible script ever (check out [S√Åbel's script](http://github.com/sabel83/latex) for that) but just to get the job done.
